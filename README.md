# ERD-MySQLcreation-manipulation

Assignment: Blogs
Objectives:
Practice designing ERDs
Create the ERD for a platform that allows users to create blogs, similar to blogspot.com.

The platform must allow users to register, create multiple blogs, and even allow the user to invite other users to be co-administrators of the blog. The administrators of the blog can change the blog name, add posts, edit posts, add comments, edit comments for each post, and upload new files associated with the blog post. We also want to capture information about which page the logged in users are viewing (e.g. page visited, when they visited, how long they stayed, IP address, name, etc). 

Use the MySQL workbench to complete this assignment.

Assignment: Books
Objectives:
Practice designing ERDs
Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks users, books, and user's favorite books.

Each book should have a title and an author, and each user should be able to save a list of their favorite books. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this database. For the purposes of this assignment, you may include the author's name directly into the book records, even though it would be better normalized by creating a separate author's table.



Assignment: Dojos and Ninjas
Objectives:
Practice designing ERDs
Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that tracks dojos and the ninjas that belong to each.

Each dojo should have a name and location; each ninja should have a name, a skill, and belong to a specific dojo. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this diagram.


Assignment: Event Planner
Objectives:
Practice designing ERDs
Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that allows users to plan events and rsvp to others' events.

Each event should have a title, a description, location, a start time, and an end time. Each user should have a name and an address. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this diagram.
